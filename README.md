## Goals

This project was undertaken to help me gain hands-on experience with modern web development frameworks, specifically MVC architectures. I aimed to familiarize myself with the Laravel framework, learn to develop scalable and maintainable web applications, and improve my skills in designing and implementing robust database systems. By working on this project, I sought to enhance my understanding of advanced web development concepts, such as routing, middleware, and Eloquent ORM, and to develop a solid foundation for building complex web applications.
